# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
    Describe is used more to organize your test while it will break the test into isolated test.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
    Is to test before you start coding and I'm neutral about this approach
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
    I think I missed this part fo the lecture I don't remember them. From I looked up it is a mock object used for test to decide if it passes or fails
4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
    API, UI, UNIT?
